🌍 Around Beto's Globe

This repository houses my Interactive Computer Graphics (ICG) project, where the core aim is to craft a personal portfolio using Three.js. It's an immersive experience that showcases my ability to combine creative visuals with web development.

Key features:
* 3D Visualizations built with Three.js
* Interactive elements for a dynamic user experience
* A demonstration of my passion for combining aesthetics and functionality
